Over 9500 demonstrations in 845 cities across 79 countries worldwide, we\'ve convinced at least 350,000 bystanders to take veganism seriously. Through the use of local standard-practice footage, we expose to the public what is intentionally hidden from them when it comes to animal exploitation. Combining this with a value-based sales approach and resource literature, we fully equip the public with everything they need in switching to a vegan lifestyle.',

As we fight against speciesism (a form of discrimination), we do not tolerate discrimination, bullying or harassment of any kind within our organisation. We expect anyone representing us to be respectful and inclusive towards people of all political, racial, religious, cultural and other groups.',
