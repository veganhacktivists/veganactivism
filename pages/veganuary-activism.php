											What are they all about?
											</h2>

											Veganuary is dedicated to changing public attitudes, while providing all the information and practical support required to make the transition to veganism as easy and enjoyable as possible. Veganuary has had an incredible degree of success in a very short time and is changing lives all over the world.
											<br><br>
											Veganuary’s founders, Jane and Matthew, knew that month-long pledges were not unusual, but felt that it could be done differently, and perhaps more successfully, by focusing on the month of January; a time for resolutions and new beginnings.
											<br><br>
											Veganuary.com is the largest website of its kind on the internet. With vegan recipes, expert advice and information, it provides all the answers to Why go vegan, but it is the support offered to answer How to go vegan that truly sets Veganuary apart.<br><br>
											
											<h2 class="post_title mb-20px">
											What type of activism do they do?
											</h2>		
											Veganuary’s vision is a world where veganism is a mainstream lifestyle choice, with positive action at all levels of society and government to promote the benefits of plant-based eating. We specialise in inspiring and educating people to make a significant lifestyle change, and then provide the support they need to help maintain it.
											<br><br>
											Non-judgemental, approachable, realistic and fresh. Veganuary’s communications are designed to appeal to the wider, non-vegan community, as we believe this is key to achieving our vision. We have created safe, welcoming, and kind environments on all of our communication platforms and are committed to keeping them this way. We support and promote our aims and objectives, and that of organisations with whom we directly collaborate. These organisations share our vision for the future.
