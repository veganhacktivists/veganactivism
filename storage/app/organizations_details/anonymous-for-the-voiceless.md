## What are they all about ?
**Anonymous for the voiceless** is an animal rights organisation that specializes in street activism. Over 9500 demonstrations in 845 cities across 79 countries worldwide, we've convinced at least 350,000 bystanders to take veganism seriously. Through the use of local standard-practice footage, we expose to the public what is intentionally hidden from them when it comes to animal exploitation. Combining this with a value-based sales approach and resource literature, we fully equip the public with everything they need in switching to a vegan lifestyle. 

Anonymous for the voiceless holds an abolitionist stance against animal exploitation and promotes a clear vegan message. As we fight against speciesism (a form of discrimination), we do not tolerate discrimination, bullying or harassment of any kind within our organisation. We expect anyone representing us to be respectful and inclusive towards people of all political, racial, religious, cultural and other groups. 

> Anonymous for the voiceless is independent of any political affiliation or religion and wish no promotion of either at our events.

## What type of activism do they do ?
The Cube of Truth is a peaceful static demonstration akin to an art performance. This demonstration operates in a structured manner that triggers curiosity and interest from the public; we attempt to lead bystanders to a vegan conclusion through a combination of local standard-practice animal exploitation footage and conversations with a value-based sales approach.

Masks, signs, and outreach literature are provided. Black clothing appropriate for the weather is essential, and please bring a fully charged laptop or tablet if you have one.
